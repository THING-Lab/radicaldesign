### Course Information:
ATLS 5519​: Advanced Special Topics in Technology, Arts, and Media: Design Studio

**Dates:** Session B: July 9 - August 9, 2019

**Times:** Tues, Wed, Thurs: 3pm - 5:30pm in ATLAS 1B25

**Maximum Enrollment:** 18, Subject to Instructor Approval

**Instructor:** Jean-Baptiste Labrune, Senior Lecturer, Sciences Po Paris, Daniel Leithinger, CU Boulder

### Course Description
Nature is not only a reservoir of shapes and processes to be inspired and learn from: it is a place to make and go experiment "beyond the Lab". In this month-long program, we will alternate traditional courses on "Radical Design" with more unusual formats such as a 24/7 open studio, “walk&make” sessions in nature, Zero workshops, lectures by invited guests and a focus on interdisciplinary creativity through hands-on activities. During the course, the participants will develop video prototypes of radical user interfaces and low tech props (diegetic artefacts). They will also create storytelling capsules in written and video form to describe fictional use and scenarios. At the end of the course, most of the material will be documented and shared in a libre & open-source fashion and eventually considered to be published in relevant conferences related with the course

### Faculty Bio: Jean-Baptiste Labrune
Jb Labrune is a designer and researcher specializing in the development and study of creative processes in the context of new programmable materials, critical design and avant garde places mixing artists, scientists and thinkers. His researches focus on the notion of "Exaptation", the way in which users of technologies reconfigure and hack them, producing original and unexpected functions and uses. 
He completed his PhD at INRIA and postdoc at MIT, then became a researcher at Bell Labs and interaction design professor at ENSAD (Arts Décos School). He then joined SciencesPo University as a lecturer while launching his practice at [Radical Design Studio](http://radicaldesign.eu/). He organized many "hybrid" workshops in art & sciences venues in France (Arts Décos, Beaux-Arts, Palais de Tokyo, Mains d'Oeuvres) & internationally (Mediamatic, Interaction Design Institute Ivréa, IMAL, Hangar, Hyperwerk, Akademie Schloss Solitude, MIT Medialab).

### Faculty Bio: Daniel Leithinger
Daniel Leithinger, assistant professor (ATLAS Institute & Computer Science) creates shape-changing human computer interfaces that push digital information past the boundaries of flat displays, and into the real world. Motivated by the belief that computers must embrace the dexterity and expressiveness of the human body, his interfaces allow users to touch, grasp and deform data physically. Daniel received his PhD at the MIT Media Lab in 2015. His academic publications have been published at ACM UIST, TEI and CHI conferences, and he has received design awards from Fast Company, Red Dot and IDEA. Projects like "inFORM" have been exhibited at the Cooper Hewitt Design Museum, Ars Electronica Museum, and the Milan Design Week.
