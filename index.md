### Course Information:
ATLS 5519​: Advanced Special Topics in Technology, Arts, and Media: Design Studio
Session B: July 9 - August 9, 2019
Tues, Wed, Thurs: 3pm - 5:30pm in ATLAS 1B25
Maximum Enrollment: 18
Instructor: Jean-Baptiste Labrune, Senior Lecturer, Sciences Po Paris

### Course Description
“Radical atoms” is a vision of human interaction with future dynamic materials that are computationally reconfigurable.  In this course, we will explore how to develop such interfaces, from the point of view of designers. What methods, tools and values will be required in the future when they will become mainstream? What are the early prototypes of these frameworks, and where do they come from in the history of HCI, Design and Speculative practices?
During the course, the participants will develop video prototypes of radical user interfaces and low-tech props (diegetic artifacts). They will also create storytelling capsules in written form to describe fictional use and scenarios. At the end of the course, most of the material will be documented in open-source and eventually considered to be published in relevant conferences related with the course.

### Faculty Bio: Jean-Baptiste Labrune
Jb Labrune is a designer and researcher specializing in the development and study of creative processes in the context of new programmable materials, critical design and avant garde places mixing artists, scientists and thinkers. His researches focus on the notion of "Exaptation", the way in which users of technologies reconfigure and hack them, producing original and unexpected functions and uses. 
He completed his PhD at INRIA and postdoc at MIT, then became a researcher at Bell Labs and interaction design professor at ENSAD (Arts Décos School). He then joined SciencesPo University as a researcher while launching his practice at [Radical Design Studio](http://radicaldesign.eu/). He organized many "hybrid" workshops in art & sciences venues in France (Arts Décos, Beaux-Arts, Palais de Tokyo, Mains d'Oeuvres) & internationally (Mediamatic, Interaction Design Institute Ivréa, IMAL, Hangar, Hyperwerk, Akademie Schloss Solitude, MIT Medialab).

### Faculty Bio: Daniel Leithinger
Daniel Leithinger, assistant professor (ATLAS Institute & Computer Science) creates shape-changing human computer interfaces that push digital information past the boundaries of flat displays, and into the real world. Motivated by the belief that computers must embrace the dexterity and expressiveness of the human body, his interfaces allow users to touch, grasp and deform data physically. Daniel received his PhD at the MIT Media Lab in 2015. His academic publications have been published at ACM UIST, TEI and CHI conferences, and he has received design awards from Fast Company, Red Dot and IDEA. Projects like "inFORM" have been exhibited at the Cooper Hewitt Design Museum, Ars Electronica Museum, and the Milan Design Week.
